1. For this project our implementation is written in pyhton. We decided to use python because we had some background
   experience reading in files and analyzing them in python. We wrote two python scripts, frequencyAnalysis.py and
   deciphertext.py. The frequencyAnalysis.py python script reads in the .txt file specified and counts the occurences of
   character srings of one-grams, bi-grams, and tri-grams. These results are then printed in the console. The decipher.py
   python script uses the cipther_map I found from the frequency analysis and used this mapping to replace each chararcter
   with its pair in the map. I then print out the new deciphered text in the console.

    Deciphered Plaintext:
    in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the
    wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. then the king's countenance was changed,
    and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
    the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the chaldeans, and the soothsayers. and the king spake, and said to
    the wise men of babylon, whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed
    with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. then came in all
    the king's wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. then
    was king belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished. now the
    queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house; and the queen spake and said,
    o king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed; there is a man in thy
    kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom
    the king nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, i say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers,
    chaldeans, and soothsayers; forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of
    dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same daniel, whom the king named
    belteshazzar; now let daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.

2. These python script are written to work with python 3.10 (what is on my VM) and no additional packages are need. Both
   programs will take an argument with -i to specify a file path to the .txt file to use (use relative path). By default
   it will use ciphertext.txt in the same directory as the script. Both scripts will output directly to the console.

3. Once we had the counts of the most common tri-grams and from those discovering some bi-grams and finally some one-grams
   which then allowed me to decipher some of the ciphertext.txt by hand to verify some of my early mappings made sense.
   I definitely think python was the right choice for this beacuse of how easy it was to read in the files.
